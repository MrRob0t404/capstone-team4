# TyroDev
TyroDev is a developer tool that displays side by side editors to allow new developers to easily find solutions to their code issues.

## The Problem
There isn't a good platform for new developers to get help with code issues and explain abstract concepts visually. 

## Why is TyroDev a Solution?
-   Easy to use interface, you can login and create an account.
    
-   Users can upload files from your computer or from your Github Repository
    
-   Side by Side editors to easily show the difference
    
- A non hostile environment for new devs to ask questions
